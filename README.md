FalcEye
=======
FalcEye was an high school project that intended to process images and calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient from two images.

The major purpose was to develop a software that could be linked with a camera/webcam to realize an "handmade" artificial viewer that aims to check the quality of mechanical products.

In the end this last step was not realized cause of little time and poor school resources.

Features
--------
* Load images
* RGB scale render
* Normalize images
* Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient from two images with same dimensions

Notes
----
* This project has been developed in Java beacuse it was the programming language that my class was studying that year.
* This project is compatible with IntelliJ IDEA, better use it to build.
* The project was tested on Windows and macOS, no feedback about Linux distributions.
* Code was written in italian, so it could be less comprensive.
